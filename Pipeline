// PIPELINE
A pipeline refers to a way of defining and managing the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes for software development. A Jenkins pipeline is a set of code that defines the steps, 
actions, and conditions for building, testing, and deploying applications.

Jenkins pipelines are typically defined using the Jenkinsfile, which is a text file written in Groovy syntax. The Jenkinsfile describes the entire build process, including the stages, steps, and 
configurations required for building and deploying the software.
The key components and concepts related to Jenkins pipelines:

1. Stages: A pipeline is divided into stages, which represent different phases or steps in the software delivery process. Each stage typically corresponds to a specific task, such as building, testing,
or deploying the application.

2.Steps: Steps are the individual actions performed within each stage. Examples of steps include compiling code, running tests, deploying to a server, or sending notifications. Jenkins provides a wide 
range of built-in steps, and you can also create custom steps using Groovy scripts.

3.Agents: Agents, also known as executors, are the worker nodes that execute the steps of a pipeline. Agents can be Jenkins agents, which are machines managed by Jenkins, or they can be defined as 
Docker containers, virtual machines, or other remote systems.

4.Declarative and Scripted Syntax: Jenkins pipelines can be defined using either the declarative or scripted syntax. Declarative syntax is recommended for most use cases, as it provides a more 
structured and concise way to define pipelines. Scripted syntax, on the other hand, offers more flexibility but can be more complex to manage.

5.Pipeline Plugins: Jenkins provides a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. Various plugins are available for integrating with source control systems, build tools, testing 
frameworks, deployment platforms, and more. These plugins can be leveraged within pipeline scripts to automate various tasks.

6.Pipeline Visualization: Jenkins provides a visual representation of pipelines, showing the progress and status of each stage and step. This allows developers and stakeholders to monitor the build 
process and quickly identify any issues or bottlenecks.
